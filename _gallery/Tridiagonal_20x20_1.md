description: "A density plot in the complex plane of the Bohemian eigenvalues of a sample of 10 million 20x20 tridiagonal matrices with entries sampled from the set {0, ±1, ±i, ±(1/sqrt(2))*(1+1i), ±(1/sqrt(2))*(1-1i)}. Color represents the eigenvalue density and the plot is viewed on [-2.7-2.7i, 2.7+2.7i]."
