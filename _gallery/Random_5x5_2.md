description: "Density plot in the complex plane of all Bohemian eigenvalues for 5x5 matrices with entries in the set {-1, 0, 1}. A close up of zero is shown to illustrate the gaps between the minimum real and complex eigenvalues and zero. Color is based on density and the plot is viewed on [-0.4-0.4i, 0.4+0.4i]."
