title: "Antipentadiagonal 20x20 1"
image: "Antipentadiagonal_20x20_1"
description: "A density plot in the complex plane of the Bohemian eigenvalues of a sample of 200,000 20x20 anti-pentadiagonal matrices with the superdiagonal and subdiagonal entries are zero. The entries are sampled from {-1, 0, 1}. Color represents the eigenvalue density and the plot is viewed on [-3-3i, 3+3i]. Plot produced by Cara Adams."
