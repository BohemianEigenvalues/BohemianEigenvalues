description: "A density plot in the complex plane of the Bohemian eigenvalues of a sample of 10 million 3x3 matrices where the entries are of the form 2X - 1 where X ~ Beta(0.01, 0.01). Color represents the eigenvalue condition number. Note that this class of matrices is not Bohemian as it is sampled from a continuous distribution. The solid curves that appear are algebraic curves and the points where the curves intersect are where eigenvalues of {-1,1} matrices lie. Viewed on [-3-3i, 3+3i]"
