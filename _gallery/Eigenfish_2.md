$$\\begin{bmatrix}
 0 & 0 & 0 & A\\\\

 B & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\
 -1 & -1 & -1 & -1

where $A$ and $B$ are independent continuous uniform random variables on $(-4, 4)$. This image represents a sample of 5 million matrices. Note that this class of matrices is not Bohemian as it is sampled from a continuous distribution. Viewed on [-3-3i, 3+3i]."
