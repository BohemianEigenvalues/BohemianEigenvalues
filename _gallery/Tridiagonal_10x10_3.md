description: "A density plot in the complex plane of the Bohemian eigenvalues of a sample of 10 million 10x10 tridiagonal matrices with entries sampled from the set {0, ±1, ±5, ±10, ±15, ±20}. Color represents the eigenvalue density and the plot is viewed on [-25-25i, 25+25i]. The real axis has been omitted from this plot."
