title: "Littlewood Degree 19"
image: "Littlewood_19"
description: "A density plot in the complex plane of the Bohemian eigenvalues of all 19x19 (Frobenius) companion matrices with entries in {-1, 1}. This is equivalent to the roots of all monic degree 19 Littlewood polynomials (polynomials with {-1, +1} coefficients). Color represents the eigenvalue density and this plot is viewed on [-1.7-1.7i, 1.7+1.7i]. For an extensive discussion of the equivalent polynomial root problem for Littlewood polynomials see <a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/\" target=\"_blank\">math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/</a>."
