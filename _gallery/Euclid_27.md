description: "A plot in the complex plane of the roots of the Euclid polynomials
$$
\\begin{align}
e_1 &= 1\\\\
e_{n+1} &= z e_1 e_2 \\cdots e_{n-1} + 1
\\end{align}
$$
 for degrees 2 through 27. Color represents the minimum degree Euclid polynomial the root is a solution of. The plot is viewed on [-1.5-i, 0.5+i]. Plot produced by Eunice Chan."
