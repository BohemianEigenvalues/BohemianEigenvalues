description: "A density plot in the complex plane of the Bohemian eigenvalues of a sample of 54 million 6x6 \"checkerboard\" matrices with entries sampled from the discrete uniform distribution on [-5, 5]. A \"checkerboard\" matrix contains zeros on the main diagonal, and every other sub/super diagonal. Color represents the eigenvalue density. Viewed on [-9-9i, 9+9i]."
