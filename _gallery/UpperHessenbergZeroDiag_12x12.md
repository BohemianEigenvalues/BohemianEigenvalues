image: "UpperHessenbergZeroDiag_12x12"
description: "A density plot in the complex plane of the Bohemian eigenvalues of a sample of 30 million 12x12 upper Hessenberg matrices with zeros along the main diagonal. The entries are sampled from {-1, 0, 1}. Color represents the eigenvalue density and the plot is viewed on [-2.25-2.25i, 2.25+2.25i]."
