description: "A density plot in the complex plane of the Bohemian eigenvalues of a sample of 25 million 4x4 matrices. The entries are independently sampled from 2X - 1 where X ~ Beta(0.01, 0.01). Color represents the eigenvalue density. Note that this class of matrices is not Bohemian as it is sampled from a continuous distribution. The solid curves that appear are algebraic curves and the points where the curves intersect are where eigenvalues of {-1, 1} matrices lie. This plot is viewed on [-3-3i, 3+3i]."
