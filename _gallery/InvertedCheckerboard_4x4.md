description: "A density plot in the complex plane of the Bohemian eigenvalues of a sample of 50 million 4x4 \"inverted checkerboard\" matrices with entries sampled from the discrete uniform distribution on [-5, 5]. A \"inverted checkerboard\" matrix contains zeros on odd sub/super diagonals (i.e. the first sub- and super-diagonals, the third sub- and super-diagonals, etc.). Viewed on [-7-7i, 7+7i]."
