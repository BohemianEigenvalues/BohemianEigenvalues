$$\\begin{bmatrix}

where $X$ is a continuous uniform random variable on $(0, 1)$, and $A$ and $B$ are independently sampled from $(7 - 9i)X - 3 + 4i$. This image represents a sample of 5 million matrices. Note that this class of matrices is not Bohemian as it is sampled from a continuous distribution. Viewed on [-3-4i, 5+4i]. Real eigenvalues have been omitted from this plot."
