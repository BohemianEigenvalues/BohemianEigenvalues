description: "A density plot in the complex plane of the Bohemian eigenvalues of a sample of 10 million 6x6 \"inverted checkerboard\" matrices with entries sampled from the set {0, ±1, ±i, ±20, ±20i}. An \"inverted checkerboard\" matrix contains zeros on odd sub/super diagonals (i.e. the first sub- and super-diagonals, the third sub- and super-diagonals, etc.). Viewed on [-45-45i, 45+45i]."
