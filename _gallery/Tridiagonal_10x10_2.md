description: "A density plot in the complex plane of the Bohemian eigenvalues of a sample of 10 million 10x10 tridiagonal matrices with entries sampled from the set {0, ±1, ±i, ±5, ±5i, ±10, ±10i, ±15, ±15i, ±20, ±20i}. Color represents the eigenvalue density and the plot is viewed on [-43-43i, 43+43i]."
