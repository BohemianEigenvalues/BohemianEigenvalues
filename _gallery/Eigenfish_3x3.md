$$\\begin{bmatrix}
 -1 & 1 & -1\\\\
 -1 & A &  1\\\\
  0 & B & 1
\\end{bmatrix}$$
where $A$ and $B$ are independent continuous uniform random variables on $(-2, 2)$. This image represents a sample of 3 million matrices. Note that this class of matrices is not Bohemian as it is sampled from a continuous distribution. Viewed on [-2-2i, 2+2i]."
