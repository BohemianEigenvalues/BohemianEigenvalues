description:  "A density plot in the complex plane of the Bohemian eigenvalues of a sample of 10 million 8x8 \"checkerboard\" matrices where the entries are sampled from the set {0, ±1, ±i}. A \"checkerboard\" matrix contains zeros on the main diagonal, and every other sub/super diagonal. Color represents the eigenvalue density. Viewed on [-3.3-3.3i, 3.3+3.3i]."
