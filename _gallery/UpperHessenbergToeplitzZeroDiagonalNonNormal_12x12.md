description: "A density plot in the complex plane of the Bohemian eigenvalues of a sample of 100 million 12x12 non-normal upper Hessenberg matrices with a Toeplitz structure, with zeros along the main diagonal. The entries are sampled from {-1, 0, 1}. Color represents the eigenvalue density and the plot is viewed on [-3-3i, 3+3i]."
