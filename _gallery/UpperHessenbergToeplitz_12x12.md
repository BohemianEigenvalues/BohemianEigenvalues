description: "A density plot in the complex plane of the Bohemian eigenvalues of a sample of 50 million 12x12 upper Hessenberg matrices with a Toeplitz structure. The entries are sampled from {-1, 0, 1}. Color represents the eigenvalue density and the plot is viewed on [-4-4i, 4+4i]. Real eigenvalues have been omitted from this plot."
