description:  "A density plot in the complex plane of the Bohemian eigenvalues of a sample of 10 million 6x6 \"checkerboard\" matrices where the entries are sampled from the set {0, ±1, ±i, ±sqrt(20)*(1+i), ±sqrt(20)*(1-i)}. An \"checkerboard\" matrix contains zeros on the main diagonal, and every other sub/super diagonal. Color represents the eigenvalue density. Viewed on [-15-15i, 15+15i]."
