title: "Cauchy 5x5"
image: "Cauchy_5x5"
description: "A density plot in the complex plane of the Bohemian eigenvalues of a sample of 30 million 5x5 Cauchy matrices where the vectors that define the entries are sampled from the set of integers {-10, ..., 10}. Color represents the eigenvalue density. Viewed on [-1.5-1.5i, 1.5+1.5i]. Plot produced by Tiam Koukpari."
